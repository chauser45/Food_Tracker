This program implements the requirements shown in the included pdf. The app consists of an interface where users are able to upload image and data posts to cloud storage/ database 
using Google firestore/firebase. Previous posts populate a list view, and users can navigate to a detailed view of each entry as well. Written using the Flutter SDK and the Dart
language. Tested on an Android emulator using Android Studio, but this can compile for OS as well with some platform specific permissions changes.

Please find the bulk of the code within the lib subdirectory.

Included is an .mp4 file showcasing the application in use.
